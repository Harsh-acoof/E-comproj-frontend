This project is a React-based frontend application that interacts with a backend API 
to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. 
It provides a user-friendly interface to manage resources (such as products, or any other entity),
leveraging React's component-based architecture and state management.

Features:
Responsive UI: A simple, clean interface for managing resources.
CRUD Operations: Allows users to create, read, update, and delete records.
React Router: Used for navigation between different pages of the app.
State Management: Utilizes React's state to manage data flow and interactions.
API Integration: Communicates with a backend API to perform CRUD actions.
Form Validation: Ensures correct data entry before performing any operation.
